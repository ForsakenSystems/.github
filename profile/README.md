# About
It is all about to note down some stuff, which got lost all the time. So nothing special, here.

And of course looks best with dark theme ;)

# Note
Note, all that can be found here is based on or powered by sheer ignorance and honest sloth.

That said, some of the stuff might be ...

- ... not correct
- ... not working as expected (for you ^^)
- ... definitely not reasonable in a productive environment
- ... for research purpose only
- ... a cheatsheet for lazy people who wants, that things just work, no matter how
